Handel IT Coding Project 

Need Android Studio to run.

Description: Connect your phone and click on play. On first run, an empty screen (just with the app name) would come up. Click on the add button on the lower right corner and enter the data into the dialog box. If the user does not enter anything for name, category, date or amount, it would not create the expense entry and would display a message asking you to enter in the missing entry value (the first missing entry value). Clicking on cancel on the dialog box would take you back to the main app screen and clicking on save would save the data entered into the database and display it on the main screen. To edit an existing entry, click on the cardview of that entry and the dialog box would come up to change the existing data. Swipe the cardview either left or right to delete it.
